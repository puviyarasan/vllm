Today, it sells over 1 million pairs per year with more than 100 brands worldwide including: Nike (Nike), Adidas (Adidas), Levi Strauss-Kahn Realty Trust (Levi Strauss) and General Mills of America (GM). The Tuxedo brand has a very large selection to choose from such as Ralph Lauren, Nublens & Co. Red Diamond Clothing Group -Red Diamond clothing brands sell red silk slippers which is what I\\'m wearing right now with my pink dress today...and that\\'s it!\\n-I don\\'t have much experience in the world of Tuxedo footwear because if you ever do anything outside of just hiking or going for a hike, they would say \"It sounds weird\" to me. However after having tried all these brands I know how amazing this product is and so far everything works out great!\\n-The reason that Red Diamond has such an awesome selection of Tuxedo shoes are because the company\\'s founder was born in Japan (I\\'m from Tokyo). He graduated high school where he taught engineering')"
